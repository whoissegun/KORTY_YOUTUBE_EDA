- In "LOVE OR LIES", 10-15-minute videos dominate, capturing 59.5% of all views. 
- In "FLOW, WITH KORTY", videos that are 0-5 minutes and 10-15 minutes are almost equally popular, collectively making up almost 90% of the views.

### User Engagement Metrics
- The channel's overall average view-to-like ratio is 14, which drops slightly to 13 for the "LOVE OR LIES" playlist but increases to 17 for the "FLOW, WITH KORTY" playlist.
- The "FLOW, WITH KORTY" playlist has a higher view-to-comment ratio (370) compared to the overall uploads (233) and the "LOVE OR LIES" playlist (153).

### No Favorites
- Across all datasets, the average view-to-favorite ratio is zero, suggesting that viewers are not using the "favorite" feature for these videos.

## Recommendations
1. **Focus on Optimal Video Length**: Given the popularity of 5-15 minute videos across all uploads and playlists, focusing on this length could maximize viewer engagement.
2. **User Engagement Strategy**: "FLOW, WITH KORTY" has a higher view-to-comment ratio (370) compared to the overall channel and the "LOVE OR LIES" playlist. This suggests that this specific playlist is generating more comments per view than other content on the channel.

On the other hand, this playlist also has a higher view-to-like ratio (17) compared to "LOVE OR LIES" (13) but is slightly higher than the overall channel's average (14). Typically, a higher view-to-like ratio might indicate that more people are watching but fewer are liking, while a lower ratio would suggest more people are liking per view.

In this context, "FLOW, WITH KORTY" seems to inspire more comments but is not necessarily translating that into "likes" at the same rate as other content. It might be useful to investigate why this particular playlist is driving more comments but not as many likes. Is it more controversial? Is it sparking discussion but not necessarily winning over the audience?

Understanding this dynamic could help in tailoring the content strategy to enhance user engagement across both metrics.
  
## Conclusion
The analysis reveals key insights into video duration and viewer engagement across Korty's channel and her main playlists. This data can be leveraged to optimize future video uploads and marketing strategies.
